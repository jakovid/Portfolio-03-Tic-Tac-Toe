# Portfolio-03-Tic-Tac-Toe
The third project in my portfolio to showcase my programming abilities.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

HTML was used to create the initial DOM elements.

JS was used to create dynamic DOM elements.

This project focuses on the use of Object Literal JS.

Key functions this project utilizes are:

1) the ability to choose between a human and a computer opponent
2) the ability to choose the player's symbol
3) a function to let the user select a square on the board
4) a function to update the DOM to display the user's turn
5) a function to check for a winner or a tied game
6) a function to display the winner
7) a function to select an opponents square at random for the easy mode
8) a function that utilizes min max to create an opponent that is unbeatable
